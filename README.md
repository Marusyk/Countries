# Countries
The task should be solved using C# programming language.
Create a simple web application, which will present information about countries.
 The application should display a list of countries. It should  allow displaying detailed information about selected country (on the same page or on separate page). The application will also allow adding new countries to the list and save data to local file.
The application will read/write countries data from/to  XML file (You have to design XML yourself. It should contain at least information about Countries' names and Capitols). The XML file should be copied to local applicationâ€™s location. 
The application should be made in such a manner that it can easily be extended to present countries data from XML files with different structure. We do NOT expect this to be implemented.
We expect that you demonstrate reasonable use of the available language functionality for abstraction, interfaces, inheritance, a good class structure and show a good programming practice. We are focused on code quality, design and interface/GUI.
